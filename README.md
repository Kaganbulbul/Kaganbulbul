## I little bit about me

🎓 &nbsp;I'm currently juggling these [Udacity](https://imp.i115008.net/BXeWKW) courses and intend to complete them soon:

- [AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://imp.i115008.net/VyRr4M)
- [Cloud Architect using Microsoft Azure](https://imp.i115008.net/7mLA1y)

🌱 &nbsp;I'm on track with learning more about MLOps, DevOps and Software Architecture.\
✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy hiking, open-sea swimming and spending time with family.\
💬 &nbsp;Lets have a Meet or Zoom call, feel free to pick a slot on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/mmphego/30min) to talk with me.\
✉️ &nbsp;You can drop me an email at mpho@mphomphego.co.za with subject containing "GitHub: ..."! It will be a pleasure to talk with you!.\
